                    <p>I fell in to coding making a small match-3 game for my Bejewelled-obsessed partner to announce our wedding.</p> 
                    <p>Since then I've been growing as a developer with a focus on front-end development for Vue based web applications as well as AWS S3 and Serverless for back end.</p> 
                    <p>I've worked many years as a policy wonk in the public service, but the slow pace finally got to me and I've made the decision to change careers.</p>
                    <p>I still make small games for friends, family and loved ones on special occasions. Even for you, if you ask nicely.</p>
